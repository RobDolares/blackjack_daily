# Blackjack Daily Project


   Implement a Blackjack hand value calculator.

   Open up the `index.html` file and your console
   to watch the assertions pass as you write your code.

   Also remember, that the parameter `hand` will be an array, so
   you'll need to parse through that first before you can start to
   write your logic.
